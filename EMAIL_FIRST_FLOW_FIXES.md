# Email-First Flow - Fixes Applied

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ‚úÖ Email Capture to Database
**Question**: Is email being captured to the database on Continue button click?

**Answer**: YES! The `handleEmailCapture` function properly saves the email:

```typescript
// Create artwork record with email captured
const createResponse = await fetch('/api/artwork/create', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    customer_name: formData.name,
    customer_email: formData.email,
    email_captured_at: new Date().toISOString(),
    upload_deferred: false
  }),
});
```

**What happens:**
1. User enters name & email
2. Click "Continue" ‚Üí Calls `handleEmailCapture()`
3. Creates artwork record in database via `/api/artwork/create`
4. Generates upload token for later use
5. Moves to upload choice screen

### 2. ‚úÖ Back Buttons Added
Added back navigation to all relevant steps:

**Upload Choice Step:**
- Back button ‚Üí Returns to email capture step
- Allows users to edit their email/name

**Photo Upload Step:**
- Back button ‚Üí Returns to upload choice step
- Allows users to choose "Upload Later" instead

**Implementation:**
```typescript
<button
  onClick={() => setFlowStep('previous-step')}
  className="flex items-center gap-2 text-gray-600 hover:text-gray-800 transition-colors"
>
  <ArrowRight className="w-4 h-4 rotate-180" />
  <span className="text-sm font-medium">Back</span>
</button>
```

### 3. ‚úÖ Upload Later Button Fixed
The "Upload Later" button WAS working correctly, but added additional logging for debugging:

**What it does:**
1. Marks artwork as `upload_deferred: true` in database
2. Sends confirmation email with unique upload link
3. Tracks analytics (Plausible + Clarity)
4. Shows success message
5. Auto-closes modal after 5 seconds

**Enhanced with:**
- Console logging for debugging
- Better error messages
- Extended auto-close time (3s ‚Üí 5s for better UX)

**Debug logs added:**
- `üïí Upload Later clicked` - When button is clicked
- `‚ùå Missing artwork info` - If artwork data is missing
- `‚úÖ Upload Later successful` - When process completes
- `‚è∞ Auto-closing modal` - Before auto-close

### 4. ‚úÖ Photo Tips Info Popup
Added helpful photo guidance popup in the upload step:

**Features:**
- Info button: "See tips for choosing good photos"
- Popup shows 3 example photos:
  - ‚úì Perfect (front-facing)
  - ‚úó Side view (avoid)
  - ‚úó Too far (avoid)
- Tip about accessories being included
- "Got it!" button to close
