# ✅ Google Ads User Type Segmentation - Implementation Complete

## 🎯 What Was Implemented

I've successfully implemented a comprehensive user type segmentation system for Google Ads that allows you to analyze performance differences between **gifters** (people buying as gifts) and **self-purchasers** (buying for themselves).

## 📦 Deliverables

### 1. **Code Implementation** ✅
All tracking code has been updated to pass `user_type` parameter to Google Ads:

- **Client-side tracking** (`src/lib/google-ads.ts`)
  - Added `userType` parameter to `trackPurchase()` function
  - Passes to both Google Ads conversion and GA4 events

- **Server-side tracking** (`src/lib/google-ads-server.ts`)
  - Added `userType` to `ServerConversionData` interface
  - Includes in conversion payload sent to Google Ads

- **Webhook integration** (`src/app/api/webhook/route.ts`)
  - Fetches artwork record to get `user_type`
  - Passes to server-side conversion tracking
  - Graceful fallback to 'unknown' if unavailable

- **Order metadata** (`src/lib/order-processing.ts`)
  - Added `artworkId` field for artwork lookup

### 3. **Monitoring Script** 🔍
**File:** `scripts/monitor-user-type-tracking.js`

- ✅ Simulates conversion tracking

**Run with:** `npm run monitor:user-type-tracking`

## 🚀 Next Steps (Manual Setup Required)

### Step 1: Deploy Code (Immediate)
The code is ready to deploy - build is successful ✅

### Step 2: Set Up Google Ads UI (1-2 hours)

#### A. Create Custom Segments
Go to **Audience Manager** and create:

**1. Gifter Segment:**
```
Name: PawPop - Gift Buyers
Parameter: user_type
Condition: equals
Value: gifter
Duration: 90 days
```

**2. Self-Purchaser Segment:**
```
Name: PawPop - Self Purchasers
Parameter: user_type
Condition: equals  
Value: self_purchaser
Duration: 90 days
```

#### B. Create Custom Columns
Go to **Campaigns > Columns** and add:

1. **Gifter Conversions**: `IF(user_type = 'gifter', Conversions, 0)`
2. **Gifter Value**: `IF(user_type = 'gifter', Conversion value, 0)`
3. **Self-Purchaser Conversions**: `IF(user_type = 'self_purchaser', Conversions, 0)`
4. **Self-Purchaser Value**: `IF(user_type = 'self_purchaser', Conversion value, 0)`
5. **Unknown Type Conversions**: `IF(user_type = 'unknown', Conversions, 0)`

#### C. Save Custom Report
```
Name: PawPop - Performance by User Type
Segment by: user_type
```

### Step 3: Wait for Data (24-48 hours)
- Segments take 24-48 hours to populate
- Custom columns show data within 24 hours

### Step 4: Verify Data Flow
```bash
# Run monitoring script
npm run monitor:user-type-tracking

# Check Google Ads
Tools & Settings > Conversions > Purchase > Segments
Look for: user_type parameter with values
```

### Step 5: Analyze & Optimize
Compare metrics by user type:
- Conversion rates
- Average order values
- Cost per acquisition
- Product preferences

## 📊 What You Can Analyze

### Conversion Rate Comparison
```
Gifter CVR vs. Self-Purchaser CVR
→ Which segment converts better?
```

### Average Order Value
```
Gifter AOV vs. Self-Purchaser AOV
→ Which segment spends more?
```

### Cost Efficiency
```
Gifter CPA vs. Self-Purchaser CPA
→ Which segment is more cost-effective?
```

### Product Preferences
```
Digital vs. Physical by user type
Size preferences by user type
```

## 🎯 Optimization Strategies

### If Gifters Perform Better:
- Create gift-focused ad copy
- Target gift occasions (birthdays, holidays, Mother's Day)
- Emphasize gift packaging
- Bid higher on gift-related keywords

### If Self-Purchasers Perform Better:
- Focus on personal enjoyment messaging
- Emphasize home decor
- Target pet owner communities
- Highlight emotional connection

### If AOV Differs:
- Adjust bidding by segment
- Create segment-specific landing pages
- Tailor product recommendations
- Optimize pricing per segment

## 🔍 Data Flow

### How It Works:
```
1. User uploads photo
   ↓
2. Selects "This is a gift" or "For myself"
   ↓
3. user_type saved to artwork record
   ↓
4. User completes purchase
   ↓
5. Webhook fetches artwork.user_type
   ↓
6. Passes to Google Ads conversion tracking
   ↓
7. Google Ads segments by user_type
   ↓
8. Custom columns calculate metrics per segment
```

## ✅ Verification Checklist

- ✅ `/GOOGLE_ADS_USER_TYPE_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` - This file

### Monitoring

- ✅ `/package.json` - Added npm script

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### No Data After 48 Hours
```bash
npm run monitor:user-type-tracking
```
Check:
- Console logs show user_type tracking
- Artwork records have user_type populated
- Google Ads segments configured correctly

### High "Unknown" Values
- Verify users complete gift selection step
- Check UploadModalEmailFirst component
- Review database records

### Custom Columns Not Working
- Verify formula syntax exactly
- Check parameter name is `user_type` (case-sensitive)
- Wait 24 hours for data
