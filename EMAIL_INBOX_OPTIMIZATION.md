# Email Inbox Optimization - Primary vs Promotions

## 🎯 **Problem Solved**

Emails were landing in Gmail's **Promotions** folder instead of **Primary** inbox.

## ✅ **Changes Made**

### **1. Subject Lines - Transactional Language**

**BEFORE (Promotional):**
- ❌ "Don't miss out on your Renaissance portrait! ✨"
- ❌ "Last chance: Your Renaissance portrait awaits! 🎨"
- ❌ "Ready to create your masterpiece? 🎨"

**AFTER (Transactional):**
- ✅ "Action Required: Complete Your PawPop Order"
- ✅ "Reminder: Complete Your PawPop Order"
- ✅ "Final Notice: Complete Your PawPop Order"

**Key Changes:**
- Removed emojis from subject lines
- Used order/action-oriented language
- Removed marketing phrases ("don't miss out", "last chance")

### **2. Email Content - Order-Focused**

**BEFORE:**
```
Headline: "Your Masterpiece is Waiting"
Message: "Just a friendly reminder that you can create your stunning 
Renaissance portrait anytime!"
```

**AFTER:**
```
Headline: "Order Status: Awaiting Photos"
Message: "You started creating a custom Renaissance portrait but haven't 
uploaded your photos yet. Your order is ready to process as soon as you upload."
```

**Key Changes:**
- Order status language instead of marketing copy
- Removed promotional urgency tactics
- Added order details (status, action needed, expiration)
- Professional, transactional tone

### **3. Email Headers**

**Added:**
- ✅ `replyTo: 'pawpopart@gmail.com'` - Encourages replies

- Urgency boxes with warnings

- Order status boxes (gray, professional)
