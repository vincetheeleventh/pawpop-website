## 📊 What Gets Tracked

### Automatic Event Tracking
| Event | Trigger | Purpose |
|-------|---------|---------|
| `upload_modal_opened` | User clicks upload CTA | Track funnel entry |
| `photo_uploaded` | Photo upload completes | Track conversion step |
| `artwork_generation_started` | Form submission | Track generation initiation |
| `artwork_completed` | Generation finishes | Track successful completion |
| `purchase_modal_opened` | User views products | Track purchase intent |
| `checkout_initiated` | User clicks buy button | Track high-intent behavior |
| `purchase_completed` | Payment successful | Track conversion |
| `error_occurred` | Any error happens | Debug issues |

### Custom Tags Set
Every session is automatically tagged with:
- `price_variant`: A or B (from Plausible A/B test)
- `variant_label`: "Standard Pricing" or "Premium Pricing"
- `funnel_step`: Current position in conversion funnel
- `environment`: development or production
- `current_page`: Page path
- `is_customer`: "true" for paying customers

### Session Upgrades (Priority Processing)
Sessions are automatically upgraded when:
- ✅ User completes artwork generation
- ✅ User initiates checkout
- ✅ User completes purchase
- ✅ Error occurs (for debugging)
- ✅ Performance issue detected (slow load, timeout)

## 🎨 Integration with Existing Analytics

### Three-Layer Analytics Stack

| Tool | Type | Purpose | Output |
|------|------|---------|--------|
| **Plausible** | Quantitative | What happens | Numbers, trends, funnels |
| **Google Ads** | Attribution | Where users come from | ROI, conversion rates |
| **Clarity** | Qualitative | Why & how it happens | Visual behavior, UX issues |

### Clarity + Plausible Integration
- Sessions tagged with price variant (A/B test)
- Filter recordings by variant to see behavior differences
- Compare UX patterns between pricing tiers
- Understand why one variant converts better

### Clarity + Google Ads Integration
- See visual playback of converting users
- Identify UX friction before conversion
- Optimize landing page based on behavior
- Understand why ads convert (or don't)

---

## 💡 Key Use Cases

### 1. Debug Upload Errors
```
Filter: last_error_type = upload_form_error
Watch 5-10 sessions to identify patterns
Fix most common error causes
```

### 2. Optimize Conversion Funnel
```
Filter: funnel_step = purchase_modal
Watch users selecting products
Identify hesitation or confusion points
Improve size selection and pricing display
```

### 3. A/B Test Insights
```
Filter: price_variant = A vs price_variant = B
Compare visual behavior between variants
See if higher prices cause visible hesitation
Validate quantitative results with qualitative data
```

### 4. Mobile UX Issues
```
Filter: Device = Mobile
Watch mobile user sessions
Identify touch target issues
Fix mobile-specific problems
```

### 5. Performance Issues
```
Sessions with slow_load = true auto-flagged
Watch sessions with slow loads
Identify performance bottlenecks
Prioritize optimization work
```
