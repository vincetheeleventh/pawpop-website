# âœ… Fix "Needs Attention" - Enable Enhanced Conversions in Google Ads

## Problem

Your Google Ads conversion actions show **"Needs Attention"** because Enhanced Conversions are not enabled. Enhanced Conversions improve conversion measurement accuracy by sending hashed customer data (email, name) alongside conversion events.

## âœ… Code Already Updated

I've updated your codebase to **automatically send enhanced conversion data**:

- âœ… **Photo Upload:** Sends email + name
- âœ… **Artwork Generation:** Sends email + name  
- âœ… **Purchase:** Sends email + name + address (from Stripe)
- âœ… **Client-side & Server-side:** Both implementations ready

**Your code is now ready** - you just need to enable it in Google Ads.

## ðŸ”§ How to Enable Enhanced Conversions in Google Ads

### Option 1: Enable Automatic Enhanced Conversions (EASIEST - RECOMMENDED)

This is the simplest method that requires no code changes.

**Steps:**

1. Go to [Google Ads](https://ads.google.com)
2. Click **Tools & Settings** (wrench icon) â†’ **Conversions**
3. Click on **each conversion action** (Photo Upload, Artwork Generation, etc.)
4. Scroll down to **Enhanced conversions** section
5. Click **Turn on enhanced conversions**
6. Select **"Automatic enhanced conversions"**
   - This detects user data from your website forms automatically
7. Click **Save**

**Repeat for all 4 conversion actions:**
- PawPop Photo Upload
- PawPop Artwork Generated
- PawPop Artwork Viewed
- PawPop Purchase

âœ… **Done!** Google will automatically detect the email and name fields from your forms.

### Option 2: Manual Enhanced Conversions via Google Tag

If automatic detection doesn't work, use manual setup:

**Steps:**

1. Go to [Google Ads](https://ads.google.com) â†’ **Tools** â†’ **Conversions**
2. Click on a conversion action
3. Click **Edit settings**
4. Scroll to **Enhanced conversions** section
5. Select **"Turn on enhanced conversions"**
6. Choose **"Google tag"** as the method
7. Click **Save**

**For each conversion action, configure:**

```
Method: Google tag
User-provided data: Email, first name, last name
```

Your code already implements this correctly - Google will automatically hash the data before sending.

## ðŸ“Š What Data We're Sending

Based on your updated code, here's what's included in enhanced conversions:

### Photo Upload & Artwork Generation
```javascript
{
  email: "customer@example.com",
  address: {
    first_name: "Jane",
    last_name: "Doe"
  }
}
```

### Purchase (from Stripe)
```javascript
{
  email: "customer@example.com",
  address: {
    first_name: "Jane",
    last_name: "Doe",
    street: "123 Main St",
    city: "Vancouver",
    region: "BC",
    postal_code: "V6B 5T1",
    country: "CA"
  }
}
```

**Privacy:** All data is automatically hashed (SHA256) by Google before transmission. Raw customer data never leaves your server.

## ðŸ†˜ Troubleshooting

2. Test in incognito mode without ad blockers
3. Use manual Google tag method instead of automatic

### Issue: "Missing user data fields" alert

**Solution:** 
1. Your code already sends email + name âœ…
2. Enable "Google tag" method in conversion settings
3. Verify gtag is loading with Tag Assistant
4. Wait 24 hours for Google to detect the data

---

### Issue: "Incorrectly formatted data" alert

**Cause:** Rare - usually due to special characters in email/name

**Solution:**
1. Your code properly formats data âœ…  
2. Check browser console for any errors
3. Test with simple email addresses first (no special chars)
