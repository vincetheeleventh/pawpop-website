# Image Download Tracking Implementation

## Overview

Successfully implemented comprehensive image download and interaction tracking for PawPop artwork images using Plausible Analytics.

## What's Being Tracked

### 1. **Right-Click Context Menu** 
- **Event**: `Image Right Click`
- **Trigger**: When users right-click on artwork images (most common way to save images)
- **Data**: Image type, artwork ID, customer info, action type

### 2. **Drag to Save**
- **Event**: `Image Drag Start` 
- **Trigger**: When users drag images to desktop/folder to save
- **Data**: Drag effect, image details, customer context

### 3. **Mobile Long Press**
- **Event**: `Image Long Press`
- **Trigger**: Touch and hold on mobile devices (500ms threshold)
- **Data**: Device type, touch count, timing

### 4. **Keyboard Shortcuts**
- **Event**: `Keyboard Save Attempt`
- **Trigger**: Ctrl+S, Ctrl+Shift+S (Save As), Ctrl+P (Print)
- **Data**: Shortcut type, page context

### 5. **Image Load Tracking**
- **Event**: `Artwork Image Loaded`
- **Trigger**: When artwork images finish loading
- **Data**: Image dimensions, load time, engagement metrics

## Implementation Details

### Files Modified:
- `/src/lib/image-tracking.ts` - Comprehensive tracking utility
- `/src/app/artwork/[token]/page.tsx` - Main artwork page tracking
- `/src/app/success/page.tsx` - Success page preview tracking
- `/src/components/analytics/PlausibleScript.tsx` - Enhanced script with file downloads
- `.env.example` - Updated Plausible script URL

### Enhanced Plausible Script:
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_PLAUSIBLE_SRC=https://plausible.io/js/script.file-downloads.outbound-links.js
```

This enables automatic tracking of:
- File downloads (any direct links to images)
- Outbound links
- Plus our custom right-click/drag tracking

## Events You'll See in Plausible Dashboard

### Primary Save Events:
1. **`Image Right Click`** - Most common save method
2. **`Image Drag Start`** - Drag-to-save behavior
3. **`Image Long Press`** - Mobile save attempts

### Secondary Events:
4. **`Keyboard Save Attempt`** - Ctrl+S shortcuts
5. **`Print Attempt`** - Ctrl+P (sometimes used to save as PDF)
6. **`Artwork Image Loaded`** - Engagement/performance metric

### Automatic Events (from enhanced script):
7. **`File Download`** - If you add direct download links
8. **`Outbound Link`** - External site clicks

## Data Captured

Each event includes:
- **Image Context**: Type (artwork_main, artwork_preview), dimensions
- **Customer Data**: Name, email, pet name, artwork ID, order ID
- **Action Details**: Method used, device type, timing
- **Page Context**: URL, user agent (mobile/desktop)
- **Price Variant**: A/B testing context maintained

## Usage Analytics

### Key Metrics to Monitor:
1. **Save Rate**: % of artwork viewers who attempt to save
2. **Save Method Distribution**: Right-click vs drag vs mobile
3. **Device Patterns**: Mobile vs desktop save behavior
4. **Customer Segments**: Which customers save most (by product type, price variant)

### Conversion Insights:
- **High Save Rate + Low Purchase**: May indicate price sensitivity
- **Save Before Purchase**: Shows consideration/sharing behavior
- **Mobile vs Desktop**: Different user behaviors by device
