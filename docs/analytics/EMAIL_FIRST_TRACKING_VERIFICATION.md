## ðŸŽ¯ New Email-First Funnel Steps

### Step 2.5: Email Captured (NEW)
Tracks when user completes email capture form before uploading photos.

**Events Fired:**
```typescript
trackFunnel.emailCaptured();
trackInteraction.formStart('Email Capture Form');
trackInteraction.formComplete('Email Capture Form');
```

### Step 2.6: Upload Deferred (NEW)
Tracks when user chooses "Upload Later" option.

**Events Fired:**
```typescript
trackInteraction.buttonClick('Upload Later', 'upload-choice');
trackFunnel.deferredUpload();
trackInteraction.formComplete('Deferred Upload Choice');
```

### Step 2.7: Deferred Upload Completed (NEW)
Will track when user returns via email link to complete deferred upload.

**Note**: This step is defined in the funnel but fires in the deferred upload page (future implementation).

## ðŸ“ˆ Analytics Dashboard Metrics

### Key Metrics to Track:

1. **Email Capture Rate**
   - Formula: `(Email Captured / Modal Opens) Ã— 100`
   - Expected: 70-85%

2. **Upload Now vs Later Split**
   - Track ratio of immediate vs deferred uploads
   - Helps optimize user flow

3. **Deferred Upload Return Rate**
   - Formula: `(Deferred Upload Completed / Upload Deferred) Ã— 100`
   - Expected: 30-50%

4. **Overall Funnel Completion**
   - Full flow from modal open to artwork completion
   - Track impact of email-first approach

5. **Manual Approval Impact**
   - Compare completion rates with/without manual approval
   - Track time to completion differences

## ðŸ”§ Testing Recommendations

### Pre-Deployment Testing:

1. **Modal Opening**
   - [ ] Open modal, verify `uploadModalOpened` fires
   - [ ] Check Clarity session replay captures event

2. **Email Capture Flow**
   - [ ] Enter email, click continue
   - [ ] Verify `emailCaptured` fires
   - [ ] Check email validation doesn't trigger tracking

3. **Upload Choice**
   - [ ] Click "Upload Now", verify button click tracked
   - [ ] Click "Upload Later", verify deferred upload tracked
   - [ ] Confirm email sent notification appears

4. **Photo Upload**
   - [ ] Upload both photos
   - [ ] Verify size and type captured
   - [ ] Test HEIC conversion tracking

5. **Artwork Generation**
   - [ ] Submit form, verify generation start tracked
   - [ ] Wait for completion, verify completion event
   - [ ] Check Google Ads conversion fires ($15 value)
   - [ ] Test manual approval conditional logic

6. **Error Scenarios**
   - [ ] Invalid email, verify no tracking fires
   - [ ] File too large, verify error tracking
   - [ ] Network error, verify error context captured

### Post-Deployment Monitoring:

1. **First 24 Hours**
   - Monitor event firing rates
   - Check for any tracking errors in logs
   - Verify Clarity recordings capturing events

2. **First Week**
   - Analyze funnel drop-off points
   - Compare email capture vs photo upload completion
   - Measure deferred upload return rate

3. **First Month**
   - Statistical analysis of A/B test variants
   - Optimize based on funnel metrics
   - Adjust email-first flow if needed
