# Email-First Upload Flow Implementation

## Overview

Successfully implemented an email-first upload flow to **increase email capture rate** by removing the friction of photo uploads before collecting user information. This allows for remarketing campaigns to users who show interest but don't immediately upload photos.

## Strategy: Option A - Email-First with Deferred Upload

Users can now:
1. **Enter email first** (minimal friction)
2. **Choose**: "Upload Photos Now" OR "I'll Upload Later"
3. **If Later**: Receive email with unique upload link
4. **Remarketing**: Automated reminder emails to drive conversions

## Implementation Components

### 1. Database Schema (`018_add_deferred_upload_tracking.sql`)

**New Columns on `artworks` table:**
- `email_captured_at` - Timestamp when email was first captured
- `upload_deferred` - Boolean flag for deferred uploads
- `upload_reminder_sent_at` - Timestamp of most recent reminder
- `upload_reminder_count` - Number of reminders sent (max 3)
- `upload_completed_at` - Timestamp when deferred upload completed
- `upload_token` - Unique token for deferred upload link

**Database Functions:**
- `generate_upload_token()` - Creates unique 32-character token
- `get_artworks_needing_reminders()` - Fetches artworks needing reminders
- `mark_reminder_sent()` - Updates reminder tracking
- `complete_deferred_upload()` - Marks upload as complete

### 2. Email Templates (`/src/lib/email.ts`)

**Email Capture Confirmation:**
- Subject: "Your Renaissance Masterpiece Awaits! ðŸŽ¨"
- Includes unique upload link
- Sent immediately after email capture

**Upload Reminders (3 cadences):**
- **Reminder #1 (24h)**: "Ready to create your masterpiece?"
- **Reminder #2 (72h)**: "Don't miss out on your Renaissance portrait!"
- **Reminder #3 (7d)**: "Last chance: Your Renaissance portrait awaits!"

Each reminder includes:
- Personalized messaging
- Unique upload link
- Example transformations
- Increasing urgency

### 3. New Upload Modal (`UploadModalEmailFirst.tsx`)

**Flow Steps:**
1. **Email Capture**: Name + Email collection
2. **Upload Choice**: "Upload Now" vs "Upload Later"
3. **Photo Upload**: Traditional upload interface (if "Upload Now")
4. **Processing**: Generation pipeline
5. **Complete**: Success message

**Key Features:**
- Clean, step-based UI
- Clear value proposition at each step
- Analytics tracking for each decision
- Error handling and validation
- Mobile-optimized

### 4. Deferred Upload Page (`/app/upload/[token]/page.tsx`)

**Features:**
- Validates upload token
- Shows customer name and email
- Clear instructions and expectations
- Opens upload modal pre-filled
- Handles expired/invalid links

### 5. API Endpoints

**Email Confirmation:**
- `POST /api/email/capture-confirmation`
- Sends immediate confirmation with upload link

**Upload Reminders:**
- `POST /api/email/upload-reminder` - Send single reminder
- `GET /api/email/upload-reminder?send=true` - Cron job endpoint

**Upload Token Management:**
- `POST /api/artwork/generate-upload-token` - Generate unique token
- `GET /api/artwork/by-upload-token` - Fetch artwork by token

### 6. Analytics Tracking

**New Funnel Events:**
- `Email Captured` (Step 2.5)
- `Upload Deferred` (Step 2.6)
- `Deferred Upload Completed` (Step 2.7)

**Tracked Metrics:**
- Email capture rate (before vs after)
- Deferred upload conversion rate
- Time to upload completion
- Email campaign effectiveness
- Funnel drop-off points

## Email Campaign Strategy

### Reminder Schedule

| Reminder | Timing | Subject | Goal |
|----------|--------|---------|------|
| Capture Confirmation | Immediate | "Your Spot is Reserved!" | Build trust, set expectations |
| Reminder #1 | 24 hours | "Ready to create?" | Gentle nudge |
| Reminder #2 | 72 hours | "Don't miss out!" | Add urgency |
| Reminder #3 | 7 days | "Last chance!" | Final push |

### Email Content Strategy

**Immediate Confirmation:**
- Welcomes user
- Explains next steps
- Sets clear expectations
- Provides upload link

**Reminder Emails:**
- Personalized greeting
- Social proof (example transformations)
- Clear CTA ("Upload Photos Now")
- Time-sensitive messaging
- Unsubscribe option

## Conversion Optimization

### Benefits

## Cron Job Setup

### Automated Reminder Sending

```bash
# Add to Vercel Cron Jobs or external scheduler
# Run every 6 hours to check for artworks needing reminders

curl -X GET "https://pawpopart.com/api/email/upload-reminder?send=true"
```

**Reminder Logic:**
- First reminder: 24 hours after email capture
- Subsequent reminders: 48 hours after last reminder
- Max reminders: 3 per artwork
- Automatically stops after max reached
