# PawPop Landing Page: Development Plan

This document breaks down the development of the PawPop landing page into key functionalities and tasks, based on the PRD.

## Phase 1: Project Setup & Core Structure

**Goal:** Initialize the project and build the static components of the landing page.

- **Task 1: Initialize Next.js Project**
  - Set up a new Next.js project with TypeScript.
  - Configure ESLint and Prettier for code quality.

- **Task 2: Create Directory Structure**
  - Organize the project with standard directories (`/components`, `/lib`, `/styles`, `/app`).

- **Task 3: Build Static UI Components**
  - Create reusable React components for each section of the landing page:
    - `Header`: Navigation and logo.
    - `HeroSection`: Main heading, high-quality example image, and primary call-to-action.
    - `ProcessSection`: Explains the "handcrafted" process with icons and text.
    - `TestimonialsSection`: Displays customer quotes and stories.
    - `EmailCaptureSection`: Form for the soft buy-in (e.g., free digital download).
    - `PricingSection`: Clear layout of product options and prices.
    - `Footer`: Links and copyright information.

- **Task 4: Centralize Copy**
  - Create `src/lib/copy.ts` to store all user-facing text for easy management.

## Phase 2: Core Functionality & Integrations

**Goal:** Implement the main user flow, from photo upload to payment.

- **Task 5: Image Upload Integration**
  - Integrate `Uploadthing` to handle secure photo uploads for both the recipient and the pet.
  - Develop the UI for file selection, upload progress, and thumbnail previews.
  - Implement error handling for failed uploads.

- **Task 6: Product Selection**
  - Connect to the Printify API to fetch available products and sizes.
  - (For MVP, this can be mocked with static data if the API is not ready).
  - Display product options for the user to select.

- **Task 7: Payment Gateway Integration**
  - Integrate the Stripe API for secure payment processing.
  - Create a checkout flow that collects payment information.
  - Handle success and error states from Stripe.

## Phase 3: Finalizing and Launch Prep

**Goal:** Polish the application, add analytics, and prepare for deployment.

- **Task 8: Styling and Responsiveness**
    - Apply a consistent and polished design using the Chakra UI component library.
  - Ensure the landing page is fully responsive and looks great on all devices (desktop, tablet, mobile).

- **Task 9: Analytics**
  - Integrate Plausible for privacy-focused analytics to track conversion rates and user behavior, as outlined in the OKRs.

- **Task 10: End-to-End Testing**
  - Manually test the entire user flow, from landing on the page to a successful purchase confirmation.
  - Test all error states (e.g., failed uploads, declined payments).

- **Task 11: Deployment**
  - Prepare the application for production.
  - Deploy the landing page to a hosting provider (e.g., Vercel, Netlify).
