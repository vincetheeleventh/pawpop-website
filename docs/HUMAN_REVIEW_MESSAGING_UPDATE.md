# Human Review Messaging Update - Complete

## ✅ **Implementation Summary**

Successfully updated the artwork confirmation page to display different messaging based on whether human review is enabled or disabled.

## 🎯 **Changes Made**

### **File Updated:** `/src/app/artwork/[token]/page.tsx`

**1. Added Import:**
```typescript
import { isHumanReviewEnabled } from '@/lib/admin-review';
```

**2. Added State Management:**
```typescript
const [humanReviewEnabled, setHumanReviewEnabled] = useState<boolean>(false);
```

**3. Added Environment Check:**
```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  // ... existing code
  
  // Check if human review is enabled
  setHumanReviewEnabled(isHumanReviewEnabled());
  
  // ... existing code
}, [params.token]);
```

**4. Updated Messaging Logic:**

**Before:**
```typescript
<p className="text-gray-600 mb-6">
  <strong>Check your email</strong> - we've sent you a confirmation with all the details. Your artwork will be ready shortly!
</p>
// ...
<p className="text-sm text-gray-500">
  This usually takes just a few minutes to complete.
</p>
```

**After:**
```typescript
<p className="text-gray-600 mb-6">
  <strong>Check your email</strong> - we've sent you a confirmation with all the details. 
  {humanReviewEnabled 
    ? 'Your artwork proof will be ready within 24 hours!' 
    : 'Your artwork will be ready shortly!'
  }
</p>
// ...
<p className="text-sm text-gray-500">
  {humanReviewEnabled 
    ? 'Our artists are carefully reviewing and refining your masterpiece to ensure the highest quality.'
    : 'This usually takes just a few minutes to complete.'
  }
</p>
```

## 📋 **Messaging Scenarios**
