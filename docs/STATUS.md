**Last Updated:** September 5, 2025

This document provides a laser-focused overview of the current project status and the next highest priority. It is a living document, intended to be updated regularly.

### Current Status

The core PawPop application is feature-complete and production-ready. The primary user flow—from photo upload to AI artwork generation, purchase, and fulfillment—is fully implemented. The backend is robust, with a comprehensive Supabase and Printify integration, and the frontend has been optimized into a high-conversion squeeze page. A comprehensive testing framework is in place, covering unit, integration, and end-to-end tests.

The project is currently in the **Launch & Optimization** phase. The immediate focus is on ensuring a smooth, reliable, and legally compliant production environment while continuing to optimize for conversion and user experience.

### Next Priority: Post-Purchase Image Upscaling Pipeline

The next highest priority is implementing the post-purchase image upscaling pipeline to ensure physical products are printed with optimal quality. This involves integrating high-resolution image enhancement after successful Stripe payments.

**Implementation Phases:**

1.  **Image Upscaling Service Integration:** Build `/api/upscale` endpoint using fal.ai Real-ESRGAN for 4x resolution enhancement of generated artworks (targeting 4K+ quality for print).

2.  **Stripe Webhook Enhancement:** Extend existing webhook to trigger upscaling pipeline for physical product purchases, extracting artwork metadata and orchestrating the print-ready process.

3.  **Print-Ready Processing:** Create `/api/printify/prepare-artwork` to handle DPI adjustment (300 DPI), color profile conversion, and format optimization before Printify integration.

4.  **Enhanced Printify Integration:** Update existing Printify workflows to accept high-resolution images with proper validation and fallback mechanisms.

**Secondary Priorities:**

- **Production Readiness:** Finalize legal compliance and monitoring setup
- **A/B Testing Optimization:** Continue purchase modal conversion testing  
- **Documentation Consolidation:** Create unified onboarding guide
