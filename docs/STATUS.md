# PawPop: Current Status, Next Priority

**Last Updated:** September 5, 2025

This document provides a laser-focused overview of the current project status and the next highest priority. It is a living document, intended to be updated regularly.

### Current Status

The core PawPop application is feature-complete and production-ready. The primary user flow—from photo upload to AI artwork generation, purchase, and fulfillment—is fully implemented. The backend is robust, with a comprehensive Supabase and Printify integration, and the frontend has been optimized into a high-conversion squeeze page. A comprehensive testing framework is in place, covering unit, integration, and end-to-end tests.

The project is currently in the **Launch & Optimization** phase. The immediate focus is on ensuring a smooth, reliable, and legally compliant production environment while continuing to optimize for conversion and user experience.

### Current Focus: Production Readiness & Optimization

With the core upscaling pipeline now complete, the focus shifts to production deployment, monitoring, and conversion optimization.

**Completed: Post-Purchase Image Upscaling Pipeline ✅**

The post-purchase image upscaling pipeline has been successfully implemented and tested:

1.  **✅ Image Upscaling Service Integration:** Built `/api/upscale` endpoint using fal.ai clarity-upscaler with 3x resolution enhancement (1024x1024 → 3072x3072) targeting 4K+ print quality.

2.  **✅ Stripe Webhook Enhancement:** Extended webhook to trigger upscaling pipeline for physical product purchases after payment completion but before Printify order creation.

3.  **✅ Enhanced Database Schema:** Added upscaling fields (`upscaled_image_url`, `upscale_status`, `upscaled_at`) with proper indexing and status tracking.

4.  **✅ Robust Printify Integration:** Updated workflows to use high-resolution upscaled images with graceful fallback to original images if upscaling fails.

**Technical Implementation Details:**
- **Processing Time:** 30-90 seconds per image with non-blocking order flow
- **Quality Enhancement:** 3x upscale factor with oil painting texture optimization
- **Error Handling:** Comprehensive fallback mechanisms ensure orders always complete
- **Test Coverage:** 16 comprehensive tests covering all scenarios (533 lines of test code)
- **Documentation:** Complete implementation guide with troubleshooting and monitoring

**Secondary Priorities:**

- **Production Readiness:** Finalize legal compliance and monitoring setup
- **A/B Testing Optimization:** Continue purchase modal conversion testing  
- **Documentation Consolidation:** Create unified onboarding guide
