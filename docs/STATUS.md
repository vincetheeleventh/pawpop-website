# PawPop: Current Status, Next Priority

**Last Updated:** September 5, 2025

This document provides a laser-focused overview of the current project status and the next highest priority. It is a living document, intended to be updated regularly.

### Current Status

The core PawPop application is feature-complete and production-ready. The primary user flow—from photo upload to AI artwork generation, purchase, and fulfillment—is fully implemented. The backend is robust, with a comprehensive Supabase and Printify integration, and the frontend has been optimized into a high-conversion squeeze page. A comprehensive testing framework is in place, covering unit, integration, and end-to-end tests.

The project is currently in the **Launch & Optimization** phase. The immediate focus is on ensuring a smooth, reliable, and legally compliant production environment while continuing to optimize for conversion and user experience.

### Next Priority: Pre-Launch Hardening & Analytics

The next highest priority is to harden the application for its initial public launch and to ensure that all necessary analytics and monitoring are in place to measure success and iterate effectively. This involves three key areas:

1.  **Production Readiness:** Finalize all legal and compliance requirements, including a thorough review of the Privacy Policy and Terms of Service. Set up production-level monitoring and error alerting to ensure any issues are addressed proactively.

2.  **A/B Testing & Conversion Optimization:** The A/B testing framework for the purchase modals is in place. The next step is to launch these tests and begin gathering data to determine the most effective purchase flow. This is critical for achieving the conversion rate targets outlined in the PRD.

3.  **Documentation Consolidation:** While the project has excellent, detailed documentation for each component, creating a top-level guide that links to these individual documents will improve onboarding and long-term maintainability.
