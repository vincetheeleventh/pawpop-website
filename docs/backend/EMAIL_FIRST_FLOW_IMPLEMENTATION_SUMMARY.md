## 📋 **NEXT STEPS FOR PRODUCTION**

### **1. Set Up Cron Job (Required)**

The reminder system needs a scheduled job to run periodically. Choose one option:

#### **Option A: Vercel Cron Jobs (Recommended)**
Create `vercel.json`:
```json
{
  "crons": [{
    "path": "/api/email/upload-reminder?send=true",
    "schedule": "0 */6 * * *"
  }]
}
```
This runs every 6 hours automatically.

#### **Option B: External Cron Service**
Use a service like:
- **Cron-job.org** (free)
- **EasyCron** (free tier available)
- **AWS EventBridge** (if using AWS)

Configure to call:
```
GET https://pawpopart.com/api/email/upload-reminder?send=true
```
Every 6 hours: `0 */6 * * *`

#### **Option C: Manual Script (Development)**
```bash
# Check what would be sent (dry run)
npm run reminders:check

# Send reminders
npm run reminders:send
```

### **2. Environment Variables**

Ensure these are set in production:
```bash
# Required
NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL=https://pawpopart.com
RESEND_API_KEY=re_...
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=...
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=...

# Optional (defaults work)
ADMIN_EMAIL=pawpopart@gmail.com
```

### **3. Test in Production**

After deployment:

1. **Test Email Capture:**
   - Visit homepage
   - Click "Create Your Masterpiece"
   - Enter email and continue
   - Verify artwork created in database

2. **Test Upload Later:**
   - Choose "I'll Upload Later"
   - Check email for confirmation with upload link
   - Click link and verify it loads

3. **Test Upload Now:**
   - Choose "Upload Now"
   - Upload photos
   - Verify generation pipeline works

4. **Test Reminders (wait 24h or manually trigger):**
   ```bash
   curl "https://pawpopart.com/api/email/upload-reminder?send=true"
   ```

### **4. Monitor System**

Check these regularly:

```sql
-- Deferred uploads pending
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM artworks 
WHERE upload_deferred = true 
AND generation_step = 'pending';

-- Reminders sent today
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM artworks 
WHERE upload_reminder_sent_at::date = CURRENT_DATE;

-- Completed deferred uploads
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM artworks 
WHERE upload_deferred = false 
AND upload_completed_at IS NOT NULL;
```

## 🎯 **USER FLOWS**

### **Flow 1: Upload Now (Immediate)**
```
User → Email Capture → "Upload Now" → Photo Upload → 
Generation → Masterpiece Creating Email → 
Admin Review (if enabled) → Masterpiece Ready Email
```

### **Flow 2: Upload Later (Deferred)**
```
User → Email Capture → "I'll Upload Later" → 
Confirmation Email with Link →
[24h] Reminder #1 →
[48h] Reminder #2 →
[48h] Reminder #3 (final) →
User Clicks Link → Photo Upload → 
Generation → Masterpiece Creating Email →
Admin Review (if enabled) → Masterpiece Ready Email
```

## 📊 **Key Metrics to Track**

1. **Email Capture Rate**: % of visitors who enter email
2. **Upload Now vs Later**: Split between immediate and deferred
3. **Deferred Upload Completion**: % who return to upload
4. **Reminder Effectiveness**: Which reminder number converts best
5. **Time to Upload**: How long users take to return

---

## 🔧 **Troubleshooting**

### **Issue: Reminders not sending**
```bash
# Check artworks needing reminders
curl "http://localhost:3000/api/email/upload-reminder"

# Check database function
SELECT * FROM get_artworks_needing_reminders(24, 3);
```

### **Issue: Upload token invalid**
```bash
# Verify token exists
SELECT id, upload_token, upload_deferred 
FROM artworks 
WHERE upload_token = 'TOKEN_HERE';
```

### **Issue: Email not received**
- Check Resend dashboard for delivery status
- Verify email domain is verified
- Check spam folder
- Verify RESEND_API_KEY is set
