# Admin Review System - Human-in-the-Loop Quality Control

## Overview

The Admin Review System implements human-in-the-loop quality control for PawPop's artwork generation and order fulfillment pipeline. This temporary system allows manual review and approval of artwork proofs and high-resolution files before customer delivery and Printify order creation.

## System Architecture

### Two Review Checkpoints

1. **Artwork Proof Review** - After fal.ai generation, before customer completion email
2. **High-Res File Review** - After upscaling, before Printify order creation

### Components

- **Database Schema**: `admin_reviews` table with review tracking
- **Admin Dashboard**: Web interface for reviewing and approving/rejecting items
- **Email Notifications**: Automated emails to pawpopart@gmail.com tagged [ADMIN]
- **API Endpoints**: RESTful APIs for review management
- **Integration Points**: Embedded in artwork generation and order processing flows

## Database Schema

### admin_reviews Table

```sql
CREATE TABLE admin_reviews (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    artwork_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES artworks(id),
    review_type VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL CHECK (review_type IN ('artwork_proof', 'highres_file')),
    status VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL DEFAULT 'pending' CHECK (status IN ('pending', 'approved', 'rejected')),
    
    -- Review content
    image_url TEXT NOT NULL,
    fal_generation_url TEXT,
    customer_name TEXT NOT NULL,
    customer_email TEXT NOT NULL,
    pet_name TEXT,
    
    -- Review metadata
    review_notes TEXT,
    reviewed_by TEXT,
    reviewed_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE,
    
    -- Timestamps
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

### artworks Table Enhancement

```sql
ALTER TABLE artworks ADD COLUMN review_status JSONB DEFAULT '{
    "artwork_proof": "not_required",
    "highres_file": "not_required"
}'::jsonb;
```

## Review Flow

### Artwork Proof Review

1. **Trigger**: After fal.ai pet integration completes successfully
2. **Location**: `UploadModal.tsx` - Step 5 in generation process
3. **Action**: Creates admin review record and sends email notification
4. **Customer Impact**: Completion email is held until approval (if human review enabled)

```typescript
// In UploadModal.tsx after pet integration
const { createAdminReview } = await import('@/lib/admin-review');
await createAdminReview({
  artwork_id: artwork.id,
  review_type: 'artwork_proof',
  image_url: finalImageUrl,
  fal_generation_url: petIntegrationResult.fal_generation_url,
  customer_name: formData.name,
  customer_email: formData.email,
  pet_name: undefined
});
```

### High-Res File Review

1. **Trigger**: After upscaling completes successfully
2. **Location**: `order-processing.ts` - After triggerUpscaling()
3. **Action**: Creates admin review record and sends email notification
4. **Customer Impact**: Printify order creation is held until approval

```typescript
// In order-processing.ts after upscaling
const { createAdminReview } = await import('./admin-review');
await createAdminReview({
  artwork_id: order.artwork_id,
  review_type: 'highres_file',
  image_url: finalImageUrl,
  customer_name: customerName,
  customer_email: session.customer_details?.email || '',
  pet_name: petName
});
```
