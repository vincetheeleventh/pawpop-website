## Component Implementation

### UploadModalEmailFirst.tsx

**Key States:**
```typescript
const [flowStep, setFlowStep] = useState<'email-capture' | 'upload-choice' | 'photo-upload' | 'complete'>('email-capture')
const [artworkId, setArtworkId] = useState<string | null>(null)
const [uploadToken, setUploadToken] = useState<string | null>(null)
const [formData, setFormData] = useState({ name: '', email: '' })
```

**Flow Steps:**

1. **Email Capture Step** (`flowStep === 'email-capture'`)
   - User enters name and email
   - Validates email format
   - Calls `/api/artwork/create` to create artwork record
   - Calls `/api/artwork/generate-upload-token` to generate token
   - Sets `artworkId` and `uploadToken` state
   - Transitions to `upload-choice` step

2. **Upload Choice Step** (`flowStep === 'upload-choice'`)
   - Presents two buttons: "Upload Now" and "I'll Upload Later"
   - **Upload Now:** Transitions to `photo-upload` step
   - **Upload Later:** 
     - Calls `/api/artwork/update` to set `upload_deferred: true`
     - Calls `/api/email/capture-confirmation` to send email
     - Shows success message
     - Closes modal after 5 seconds

3. **Photo Upload Step** (`flowStep === 'photo-upload'`)
   - Shows UploadThing file upload interface
   - User uploads pet mom photo and pet photo
   - Calls `/api/upload/complete` after successful upload
   - Triggers artwork generation pipeline
   - Sends "Masterpiece Creating" email

4. **Complete Step** (`flowStep === 'complete'`)
   - Shows success message
   - Closes modal automatically

## Testing & Verification

### Manual Testing Checklist

**Path 1: Upload Now**
- [ ] Enter email and click Continue
- [ ] Verify artwork record created in database
- [ ] Verify upload token generated
- [ ] Click "Upload Now"
- [ ] Upload photos successfully
- [ ] Verify "Masterpiece Creating" email received
- [ ] Wait for generation to complete
- [ ] Verify "Masterpiece Ready" email received (if manual review disabled)
- [ ] Verify admin notification email sent (if manual review enabled)

**Path 2: Upload Later**
- [ ] Enter email and click Continue
- [ ] Verify artwork record created in database
- [ ] Verify upload token generated
- [ ] Click "I'll Upload Later"
- [ ] Verify confirmation email received with upload link
- [ ] Click upload link from email

- [ ] Wait 24 hours (or manually trigger reminder job)
- [ ] Verify first reminder email received
- [ ] Wait 48 hours
- [ ] Verify second reminder email received
- [ ] Wait 48 hours

## Error Handling

### Upload Token Generation Failure
```typescript
if (!tokenResponse.ok) {
  const tokenError = await tokenResponse.json();
  throw new Error(tokenError.error || 'Failed to generate upload token');
}
```
**User Impact:** Shows error message, prevents progression to upload choice step

### Email Sending Failure
```typescript
try {
  await fetch('/api/email/capture-confirmation', { ... });
} catch (error) {
  console.error('Failed to send confirmation email:', error);
  // Continue anyway - user can still use the upload link
}
```
**User Impact:** Process continues, user can still access upload via direct URL

### Invalid Upload Token
```typescript
if (!artwork || !artwork.upload_token) {
  return <div>Invalid or expired upload link</div>;
}
```
**User Impact:** Shows error page, prompts user to start over

## Migration Guide

### Applying Migration 018

**File:** `supabase/migrations/018_add_deferred_upload_tracking.sql`

**Apply via Supabase Dashboard:**
1. Go to Supabase Dashboard ‚Üí SQL Editor
2. Copy entire migration file
3. Paste and run
4. Verify with: `SELECT * FROM artworks LIMIT 1;` (should show new columns)

**Verify Installation:**
```bash
node scripts/check-upload-token-function.js
```

Expected output:
```
‚úÖ Function exists and works! Generated token: abc123xyz789...
‚úÖ Column upload_token exists in artworks table
```

---

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
1. **SMS Notifications** - Send upload reminders via SMS for higher engagement
2. **Reminder Customization** - Allow users to set preferred reminder schedule
3. **Upload Progress Tracking** - Show progress bar during deferred upload completion
4. **Email Preferences** - Allow users to opt-out of reminder emails
5. **Analytics Integration** - Track conversion rates for immediate vs deferred uploads

### Monitoring & Analytics
- Track email open rates for each email type
- Monitor conversion rates: email capture ‚Üí upload completion
- Track reminder effectiveness (which reminder number converts best)
- Monitor token expiration and renewal requests

---

## Support & Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue:** User doesn't receive confirmation email
- Check Resend API key is configured
- Verify email domain is verified in Resend
- Check spam folder
- Verify email address is valid

**Issue:** Upload token invalid or expired
- Tokens are valid for 30 days
- Check database for token existence
- Verify token matches URL parameter exactly

**Issue:** Reminders not being sent
- Verify cron job is running
- Check database function `get_artworks_needing_reminders()` returns results
- Verify `upload_reminder_count < 3`
- Check `email_captured_at` timestamp is old enough

### Debug Commands

**Check deferred uploads:**
```sql
SELECT id, customer_email, email_captured_at, upload_deferred, upload_reminder_count
FROM artworks
WHERE upload_deferred = true
ORDER BY email_captured_at DESC;
```

**Check artworks needing reminders:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM get_artworks_needing_reminders(24, 3);
```

**Manually trigger reminder:**
```bash
node scripts/send-upload-reminder.js --artwork-id=uuid-here
```
