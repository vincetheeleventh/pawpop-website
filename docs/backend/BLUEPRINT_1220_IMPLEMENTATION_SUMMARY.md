      { size: '20x30', price: 4800, variant_id: 92402 }  // $48 CAD
    ]
  }
}
```

### Files Modified
- `/src/app/api/printify/generate-mockups/route.ts` - Core implementation
- `/docs/backend/BLUEPRINT_1220_IMPLEMENTATION.md` - Technical documentation
- `/docs/PRODUCTS.md` - Product catalog updates

### Scripts Created
- `/scripts/check-blueprint-1220.js` - Blueprint verification
- `/scripts/check-printify-choice.js` - Provider analysis
- `/scripts/find-fine-art-alternatives.js` - Alternative research
- `/scripts/test-blueprint-1220-implementation.js` - Implementation testing

## 🚨 Current Limitations

### Geographic Restrictions
- ✅ **United States**: Full Fine Art print support
- ❌ **Canada**: No art print shipping
- ❌ **Europe**: No art print shipping
- ❌ **United Kingdom**: No art print shipping

### Business Impact
- **Reduced Market**: ~75% reduction in addressable market for art prints
- **Quality Trade-off**: Premium quality for US vs. no service for international
- **Customer Experience**: May cause confusion for international customers

## 🔮 Future Implementation Plan

### Blueprint 494 (EU Option)
- **Provider**: Print Pigeons (ID: 36)
- **Quality**: Giclée (192 g/m²) - Good but not Fine Art level
- **Shipping**: EU countries only (no UK/US/CA)
- **Status**: Documented but not implemented

### Recommended Next Steps
1. **Implement Region Detection**: Show appropriate products based on customer location
2. **Customer Communication**: Clear messaging about shipping limitations
3. **Find Global Alternative**: Research blueprints with worldwide shipping + Fine Art
4. **Hybrid Approach**: Different quality levels for different regions

## 🧪 Testing Results

### Configuration Test
```bash
node scripts/test-blueprint-1220-implementation.js
