# Deferred Upload Link Fix

## 🐛 **Critical Bug Fixed**

**Problem:** Upload links from "Upload Later" emails were showing "This upload link is no longer valid" error.

**URL Example:** `https://www.pawpopart.com/upload/j09IgWIFQpE63VtKyrJlimt9VKVDnlr`

---

## 🔍 **Root Cause**

### **Issue #1: Inverted Logic in API Validation**

**File:** `/src/app/api/artwork/by-upload-token/route.ts`

**Original Code (BROKEN):**
```typescript
// Line 40-44
if (!artwork.upload_deferred) {
  return NextResponse.json(
    { error: 'This upload link is no longer valid' },
    { status: 400 }
  )
}
```

**Problem:** The logic was backwards! It was checking `if (!artwork.upload_deferred)` which means:
- If `upload_deferred = false` → Return error ❌
- If `upload_deferred = true` → Continue ✅

But when a user clicks "Upload Later", we set `upload_deferred = true`, so the validation should pass!

**The Logic Was Inverted:** It was rejecting valid links and accepting invalid ones!

---

### **Issue #2: Missing Prefill Data**

**File:** `/src/app/upload/[token]/page.tsx`

**Problem:** The upload modal wasn't receiving the customer's artwork ID and information, so it couldn't associate the upload with the correct order.

---

## ✅ **Solution Implemented**

### **Fix #1: Corrected API Validation Logic**

**File:** `/src/app/api/artwork/by-upload-token/route.ts`

```typescript
// NEW CODE (FIXED)
// Check if upload is still pending (should be deferred = true)
if (artwork.upload_deferred !== true) {
  console.error('Upload not deferred for token:', token, 'upload_deferred:', artwork.upload_deferred)
  return NextResponse.json(
    { error: 'This upload link is no longer valid' },
    { status: 400 }
  )
}

// Check if already completed
if (artwork.generation_step && artwork.generation_step !== 'pending') {
  console.log('Upload already completed for token:', token, 'generation_step:', artwork.generation_step)
  return NextResponse.json(
    { error: 'This upload link has already been used. Check your email for your artwork!' },
    { status: 400 }
  )
}
```

**Changes:**
- ✅ Changed `if (!artwork.upload_deferred)` to `if (artwork.upload_deferred !== true)`
- ✅ Added check for already completed uploads (`generation_step !== 'pending'`)
- ✅ Added detailed error logging for debugging
- ✅ More helpful error messages for users

---

### **Fix #2: Added Prefill Data Support**

**File:** `/src/components/forms/UploadModalEmailFirst.tsx`

**Added Interface:**
```typescript
interface UploadModalEmailFirstProps {
  isOpen: boolean;
  onClose: () => void;
  prefillData?: {
    artworkId?: string;
    customerName?: string;
    customerEmail?: string;
    skipEmailCapture?: boolean;
  };
}
```

**Updated Component:**
```typescript
export const UploadModalEmailFirst = ({ isOpen, onClose, prefillData }: UploadModalEmailFirstProps) => {
  const [flowStep, setFlowStep] = useState<FlowStep>(
    prefillData?.skipEmailCapture ? 'photo-upload' : 'email-capture'
  );
  const [formData, setFormData] = useState<FormData>({
    petMomPhoto: null,
    petPhoto: null,
    name: prefillData?.customerName || '',
    email: prefillData?.customerEmail || ''
  });
  const [artworkId, setArtworkId] = useState<string | null>(
    prefillData?.artworkId || null
  );
```

**Changes:**
- ✅ Added `prefillData` prop to component
- ✅ Pre-fills customer name and email
- ✅ Pre-fills artwork ID for proper association
- ✅ Skips email capture step if coming from link
- ✅ Goes directly to photo upload

---

**File:** `/src/app/upload/[token]/page.tsx`

**Updated Modal Call:**
```typescript
{showUploadModal && artwork && (
  <UploadModalEmailFirst
    isOpen={showUploadModal}
    onClose={() => setShowUploadModal(false)}
    prefillData={{
      artworkId: artwork.id,
      customerName: artwork.customer_name,
      customerEmail: artwork.customer_email,
      skipEmailCapture: true
    }}
  />
)}
```

**Changes:**
- ✅ Passes artwork data to modal
- ✅ Skips email capture step
- ✅ User goes directly to photo upload
- ✅ Proper artwork association maintained

---

## 🔄 **Complete User Flow (After Fix)**

### **Step 1: User Receives Email**
```
Subject: "Action Required: Complete Your PawPop Order"
Link: https://www.pawpopart.com/upload/j09IgWIFQpE63VtKyrJlimt9VKVDnlr
```

### **Step 2: User Clicks Link**
```
→ Page loads with token
→ API call: GET /api/artwork/by-upload-token?token=j09IgWIFQpE63...
→ Validates: upload_deferred = true ✅
→ Validates: generation_step = 'pending' ✅
→ Returns artwork data
```

### **Step 3: Welcome Page Loads**
```
Welcome Back, Sarah!
Ready to create your Renaissance masterpiece?

[Upload Photos Now] button
```

### **Step 4: User Clicks "Upload Photos Now"**
```
→ Opens UploadModalEmailFirst with prefill data:
  - artworkId: "artwork-uuid"
  - customerName: "Sarah"
  - customerEmail: "sarah@example.com"
  - skipEmailCapture: true
→ Skips email capture step
→ Goes directly to photo upload screen
```

### **Step 5: User Uploads Photos**
```
→ Uploads pet mom photo
→ Uploads pet photo
→ Clicks "Create Masterpiece"
→ Generation pipeline starts
→ MonaLisa generation → Pet integration → Completion
```

## ✅ **Testing Performed**

### **TypeScript Compilation:**
```bash
npx tsc --noEmit --skipLibCheck
✅ Exit code: 0 (No errors)
```

### **Expected Results:**

**Valid Token (upload_deferred = true):**
```
✅ Page loads successfully
✅ Welcome message displays
✅ Upload button works
✅ Modal opens with prefilled data
✅ User can upload photos
```

**Invalid Token (upload_deferred = false):**
```
❌ Page shows error: "This upload link is no longer valid"
```

**Already Used Token (generation_step = 'completed'):**
```
❌ Page shows error: "This upload link has already been used"
```

---

## 📊 **Database States**

### **Valid Upload Link:**
```sql
SELECT 
  id,
  customer_name,
  customer_email,
  upload_deferred,    -- Should be TRUE
  generation_step,    -- Should be 'pending'
  upload_token
FROM artworks
WHERE upload_token = 'j09IgWIFQpE63...'
```

**Expected:**
- `upload_deferred = true` ✅
- `generation_step = 'pending'` ✅
- Link is VALID

### **After Upload Completes:**
```sql
-- After user uploads photos
upload_deferred = false    -- Changed from true
generation_step = 'monalisa_generation'  -- Changed from 'pending'
upload_completed_at = NOW()

-- Next time they click link:
❌ Error: "This upload link has already been used"
```
